# 👋 Hello there — I'm Arnab Chakraborty!

Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Full time learner

Welcome to my corner of the digital world.

Hi, I'm Arnab – a Data Scientist working in the field of machine learning and data-driven solutions. I focus on building models that learn from real-world data and drive insights, whether it’s predicting trends, understanding text, or making sense of complex datasets. I want to contribute in organizations making smarter and data-backed decisions.

I’ve worked across a range of projects, from exploring NLP techniques to computer vision problems. I enjoy tackling problems that require both creativity and technical depth. My expertise can be better understood in the below section.

Based in Kolkata, I’m excited about leveraging my expertise to drive meaningful impact across industries. I’m always looking for opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge projects and learn from others in the data science community.
